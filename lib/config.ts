  about:
    "I'm Dylan, a rising senior at Columbia University. I'm super into broadening my horizons in both math and computer science, with my current interests being Mechanistic Interpretability and Representation Learning. I also love more general CS/Software Engineering, and have recently gotten much more into high performance computing (HPC) and web development. I am also an avid jazz trumpet player/multi-instrumentalist, with experience playing at many notable venues in NYC",
